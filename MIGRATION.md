# Migration Guide: CocoaPods to Tuist

This guide helps you migrate your RBSFiveStarRating development workflow from CocoaPods to Tuist.

## Why Tuist?

CocoaPods has moved into a read-only/maintenance mode and is no longer actively developed. Tuist provides:

- ✅ Modern Xcode project generation
- ✅ Better performance and build times
- ✅ Native Swift Package Manager support
- ✅ Reduced Git conflicts with generated projects
- ✅ Enhanced CI/CD integration
- ✅ Active development and community support

## For Library Users

**No action required!** The library is still available via CocoaPods:

```ruby
pod 'RBSFiveStarRating'
```

## For Contributors

### Quick Start with Tuist

1. **Install Mise** (Tuist version manager):
   ```bash
   curl https://mise.run | sh
   ```

2. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RbBtSn0w/RBSFiveStarRating.git
   cd RBSFiveStarRating
   mise install
   ```

3. **Generate and open project**:
   ```bash
   mise x tuist -- tuist generate
   ```

That's it! The Xcode project opens automatically.

### What Changed?

| Aspect | CocoaPods (Old) | Tuist (New) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Project generation | `pod install` in Example dir | `tuist generate` in root dir |
| Workspace file | Committed to git | Generated (ignored in git) |
| Project file | Committed to git | Generated (ignored in git) |
| Dependencies | Podfile | Project.swift manifest |
| Build | Open `.xcworkspace` | `tuist generate` creates project |

### Common Tasks

| Task | Tuist Command |
|------|---------------|
| Generate project | `mise x tuist -- tuist generate` |
| Build | `mise x tuist -- tuist build` |
| Run tests | `mise x tuist -- tuist test` |
| Clean | `mise x tuist -- tuist clean` |

### CI/CD Changes

The GitHub Actions workflow now:
- Installs Tuist via Mise
- Runs `tuist generate` to create the project
- Builds and tests using the generated project

No manual `pod install` required!

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I get "command not found: tuist"**
- Make sure Mise is installed and Tuist is installed via `mise install tuist@latest`
- Add Mise to your PATH: `echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc` (or zsh)

**Q: Can I still use CocoaPods?**
- Yes! The Example directory still has Podfile for legacy support
- However, we recommend migrating to Tuist for the best experience

**Q: Where did the .xcodeproj and .xcworkspace files go?**
- They're now generated by Tuist and ignored in git
- Run `tuist generate` to create them locally

**Q: How do I modify the project structure?**
- Edit `Project.swift` in the root directory
- Run `tuist generate` to apply changes
